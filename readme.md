# FLEX 4: ANIMATED TIMEMACHINE LAYOUT

The new layout architecture in Flex 4 is pretty cool. It’s much much simpler to implement complex layouts than what was possible with Flex 3. So the other day I was asked to develop a TimeMachine-like layout. It eventually ended up being done with Flex 3 but before that I had a chance to give a try with the new layout system.

So I picked a bit of [Evtim’s Wheel layout](http://evtimmy.com/2009/06/wheellayout-source-and-quick-mashup/), added a bit of [Ryan Campbell’s 5 3D Layouts](http://www.ryancampbell.com/2009/06/16/heres-5-3d-layouts-for-flex-4/) (who got himself inspired by Evtim’s example), blended the whole thing in my own recipe and ended up with something I thought I should share.

It’s not optimized, some things can certainly be done a different/better way, but at least it works reasonably well and gives another idea of how easy it is to implement complex layouts with Flex 4.
